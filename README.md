# Zoo - Animal Tracker

#### An app completed to fulfill the 3rd week of Epicodus' Javascript course.

#### by Jessie Waite

## Description

This application was made to satisfy the week three code review for Epicodus Javascript course. The application allows a user to enter information about zoo animals to keep track of them. The application takes input from the user, then displays a list of all animals stored. The application allows the user to edit information previously entered. The application also allows the user to generate a list of young animals (animals younger than 3 years old), and old animals (animals older than 10 years old).

## Technologies used:

This application is essentially built using Javascript Angular and Typescript.

## Set-Up:

In order to set-up this application, follow these directions: - Clone the application to your desktop from Github - Ensure Node Project Manager (NPM) is installed on your device. Initialize NPM in the project by entering "NPM init" at the root level of the directory. - Ensure Bower is installed on your device. Initialize Bower in the project by entering "bower init" at the root level of the directory. - Enter "gulp build" to compile Typescript into Javascript. - In the command line, run '$gulp serve' to launch the application in your web browser.

### TLDR: To start:

  _ $ npm install_
  _ $ bower init_
  _ $ bower install_
  _ $ gulp build_
  _ $ gulp serve_

## Known Bugs:

_ If you press "Click to see which animals..." (both buttons), the list generates without wiping the previous entries, so you may get the same list duplicated._
